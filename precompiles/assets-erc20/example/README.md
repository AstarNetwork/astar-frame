# How to Convert Existing ERC20 Token Into XC20 Asset
This an example how you can enhance already deployed ERC20 token to cross-chain-ready XC20 asset.

## Wrapped token in General
A wrapped token is a token whose value is tied to an underlying cryptocurrency. An amount of the original token is locked in a digital vault, and in return this allows an equivalent amount of wrapped tokens to be minted.

This is useful for several reasons, to mention a few:
* To extend the functionalities of an existing token in conjunction with other ERC20 modules.
* Allow a native cryptocurrency to behave like an ERC20, e.g. Wrapped ether (WETH).
* Allow the use of currencies outside its native blockchain, e.g. Wrapped bitcoin (WBTC).

In this example we'll do a mix of 1st and 3rd use case. We are wrapping existing ERC20 token to become XC20.

## Wrapping ERC20 example
Underlaying token will be existing ERC20, let's name it BURRITO. We want to wrap this BURRITO token and make it cross-chain-ready. Using standard [ERC20Wrapper](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/openzeppelin-contracts/blob/master/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Wrapper.sol) token spec from OpenZeppelin will not be enough. Therefore we will override some of the  ERC20Wrapper functions to use XC20+ functions.
Let's call this new wrapped token xcBURRITO.
This xcBURRITO takes the address of the underlaying token (BURITTO) and the newly created asset's address as a constructor parameters. And weâ€™ll set values for all the other required parameters, notice that we have to include ERC20Permit constructor call because xcBURRITO is now a parent for BURITTO.
```
constructor(IERC20 burrito)
   ERC20("Wrapped Burrito", "xcBUR")
   ERC20Permit("Wrapped Burrito")
   ERC20Wrapper(burrito)
{}
```
Since we can't use ERC20Wrapper out of box we'll override it to use XC20+ interface
```
import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/extensions/ERC20Wrapper.sol";
import "./Burrito.sol";

contract XcBurrito is Xc20Plus, ERC20Wrapper, BURITTO{
    constructor(IERC20 burrito)
    Xc20Plus("Wrapped Burrito", "xcBUR")
    ERC20Permit("Wrapped Burrito")
    ERC20Wrapper(burrito)
    {}

    function _mint(address _to, uint256 _amount)
        internal
        override(ERC20)
    {
        // add here your pre-mint hooks if needed

        require(
            IERC20Plus(xcBurrito).mint(_to, _amount), "Minting xc token failed"
        );

        // add here your post-mint hooks if needed
    }
}
```

## Procedures
### 1. Create XC20 asset
Follow the documentation on how to [Create XC20 Assets](https://docs.astar.network/docs/xcm/building-with-xcm/create-xc20-assets)

### 2. Deploy XcBurrito.sol smart contract
To deploy XcBurrito contract you need 2 input parameters
- Burrito ERC20 token address (H160)
- XC20 asset address (H160)
    - Follow instructions on how to [Generate XC20 Address](https://docs.astar.network/docs/xcm/integration/tools). If your asset_id is 17 (=0x11), your EVM address will be `0xffffffff00000000000000000000000000000011`

### 3. Transfer xc asset ownership to the XcBurrito smart contract
To enable xcBurrito contract to be able to mint/burn you need to call `setTeam()` extrinsic on pallet-assets. Since the EVM contract has 24 bytes (H160), we need to transform EVM address into SS58 format to be able to call this extrinsic.

After you set the team you should renounce the ownership over the xc20 asset by calling `transferOwnership()` extrinsic on pallet-assets.

Now XcBurrito contract can start minting xc20 tokens for the callers who own Burrito ERC20 token.

## User actions
To convert Burrito token into XcBurrito assets, users will need to do two actions.
1. User Approves XcBurrito smart contract to transfer ERC20 Burrito tokens from user's balance to the XcBurrito contract. As an alternative use `permit()` call to improve UX
2. User calls XcBurrito `depositFor()` for minting new xc20 tokens or `withdrawTo()` for burning xc20 tokens

## End result
The result for `depositFor(user, amount)` will be:
- XcBurrito locks `amount` of ERC20 Burrito token
- User's balance for ERC20 Buritto is decreased for `amount`
- XcBurrito contract mints `amount` of XcBurrito asset
- User's balance for XcBurrito asset is increased for `amount`


The result for `withdrawTo(user, amount)` will be:
- XcBurrito contract burns `amount` of XcBurrito asset
- User's balance for XcBurrito asset is decreased for `amount`
- XcBurrito contract sends `amount` of ERC20 Burrito token to user
- User's balance for ERC20 Burrito is increased for `amount`
